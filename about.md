    <h3>What is Korfball?</h3>
    <p>Korfball is a fast-paced, mixed-gender ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. It's played by two teams of eight players, with four female and four male players in each team. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket that is mounted on a 3.5m high pole.</p>
    <p>It's a fantastic sport for improving fitness, coordination, and tactical thinking, all while being part of a supportive team.</p>
