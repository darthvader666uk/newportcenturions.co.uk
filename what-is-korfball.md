    <h1>What is Korfball?</h1>
    <p><strong>Korfball</strong> is a fast-paced, mixed-gender ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket that is mounted on a 3.5m high pole. It's played by two teams of eight players, with four female and four male players in each team.</p>
    <p>Korfball encourages equal participation from all players, regardless of gender. The rules are designed to promote cooperation, fair play, and skill development. Uniquely in sports, Korfball is mixed gender, but each gender can only defend their own gender, i.e. men can only defend men and women can only mark up against women.</p>
    <p>Korfball was invented in the Netherlands in 1902 and has since spread around the world, and is being played in 69 countries. The sport is recognized for its emphasis on teamwork, making it an ideal sport for building friendships and fostering a sense of community.</p>
    <p>It's a fantastic sport for improving fitness, coordination, and tactical thinking, all while being part of a supportive team. Whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, korfball offers a fun and challenging way to stay active and meet new people.</p>
