    <h1>What is Korfball?</h1>
    <p><strong>Korfball</strong> is a fast-paced, mixed-gender ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket that is mounted on a 3.5m high pole. It's played by two teams of eight players, with four female and four male players in each team.</p>
    <p>Uniquely in sports, Korfball is mixed gender, but each gender can only defend their own gender, i.e. men can only defend men and women can only mark up against women.</p>
    <p>Korfball was invented in the Netherlands in 1902 and has since spread around the world, and is being played in 69 countries.</p>
